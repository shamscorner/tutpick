# Constants

This folder contains all the shared constant values for the `(dashboard)` module.

Here, you can find and modify the constants that are used throughout the module to ensure consistency and reusability.

Feel free to add, update, or remove any constants as needed to meet the requirements of your project.

For example,

```typescript
// index.ts
export const NAME = 'value';
export const SOME_CONSTANTS = {
	SOME_VALUE: 'some value',
	ANOTHER_VALUE: 'another value'
};
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these shared components, please refer to the starter guide or reach out to our support team.

Happy coding!
