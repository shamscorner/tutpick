```typescript
// index.ts
// Example helper function
export function capitalizeString(str) {
	return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these shared helpers, please refer to the starter guide or reach out to our support team [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).
