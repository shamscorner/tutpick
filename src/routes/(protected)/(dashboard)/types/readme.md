# Types

This folder contains all the TypeScript types used across the module. Typescript types are used to define the shape and structure of data in your application. They help ensure type safety and provide better code documentation.

Example:

```typescript
// index.ts
// Example type definition
export interface User {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	email: string;
}
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these types, please refer to the starter guide or reach out to our support team [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).

Happy coding!
