# Services

This folder contains all the services for this module. Services are used to handle business logic, data fetching, and other operations that are not directly related to the UI. They help keep your components clean and focused on rendering the UI, while the services handle the underlying logic.

Example:

```typescript
// index.ts
// Example service function
export function fetchData() {
	// Code to fetch data
}
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these services, please refer to the starter guide or reach out to our support team [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).

Happy coding!
