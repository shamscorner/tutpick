# Stores

This folder is used to store shared reactive values across the module. Stores are a way to manage and share state between different components in your application. They help keep your data consistent and synchronized, making it easier to manage complex application states.

Example:

```typescript
// index.ts
// Example store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const count = writable(0);
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these stores, please refer to the documentation or reach out to our support team at [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).

Happy coding!
