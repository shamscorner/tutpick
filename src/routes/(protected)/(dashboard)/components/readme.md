# Components

This folder contains all the shared components for the `(dashboard)` module.
To use these components, simply import them into your `(dashboard)` module and start using them in your code. This folder is a convenient place to store reusable UI elements, such as buttons, forms, and cards, that can be used across different pages or sections of your dashboard. Feel free to explore the different components available and customize them to fit your specific needs.

For example,

```typescript
// example.svelte
// widget.svelte
// etc.
```

If you need any assistance or have any questions regarding these shared components, please refer to the starter guide or reach out to our support team [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).

Happy coding!
