# Utils

This folder contains utility functions that are used across the module. Utility functions are small, reusable functions that perform specific tasks and help simplify complex operations. They are designed to be independent of the UI and business logic, making them versatile and easy to use.

Example:

```typescript
// index.ts
// Example utility function
export function formatWidgetDataByDate(date: Date) {
	// Code to format the date
}
```

If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding these utility functions, please refer to the documentation or reach out to our support team at [support@shamscorner.com](support@shamscorner.com).

Happy coding!
